Hi there 👋👋👋! Here's my public repository for Zero-Knowledge University. It is a course offerred to developers that wish to get better at zero-knowledge proofs, an up-and-coming cryptocraphic technology.

If you have no idea what I'm talking about, check [this](https://hackernoon.com/eli5-zero-knowledge-proof-78a276db9eff) out, or [this](https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/protocol/zero-knowledge-proof/).

You can also check my [Notion](https://eliastazartes.notion.site/Found-on-the-web-my-curated-list-of-cool-articles-5fc33dd86e8a4be8ad63a208770ba26b) page, where I curate some interesting articles I found on the internet and search for zero-knowledge research papers. I also wrote a [short article](https://eliastazartes.notion.site/onboarding-to-crypto-b97fc44c0dae4d5cba1a1ceda2aa41dc) to onboard people about web3.
